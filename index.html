<p>Vespocket is a mobile online personal doctor to patient service that lets patients discuss things with real doctors with years of experience. By leveraging the power of the web and social media to connect available doctors to available patients, we can leave out the middle corporations. This is why our service is cheaper than traditional services and we doctors still get paid a living wage. This makes it easy to get a quick detailed answer to a question (or questions) without making an appointment and spending a day waiting to see a doctor. Vespocket can save hundreds of thousands of dollars on medical fees by providing preventive care advice in situations patients don't want to go to a hospital or a  connecting them with doctors who have a little extra time or are getting older and want to stop working as much but don't want to fully retire.</p>

<p>Currently Vespocket is in BETA and under development. If you are interested in becoming a Beta user you may contact our webmaster at <a href="mailto:xirtus@gmail.com">xirtus@gmail.com</a></p>
